## Tiny Encryption Algorithm

This project implements tiny encryption algorithms with four modes of operation: ECB, CBC, CFB and OFB. 

## Note 

Use .bmp image or .txt file.

## Tests

There are 4 test files. All tests controlls from Main file.
Running the test files will create 2 images: one for encrypting the image, and the other for decrypting the image that was just encrypted.
